        Mindmap: Cyber Attacks
- Phishing
  - Description: Fraud using fake emails, texts, or websites to trick individuals into providing personal information.
  - How it works: Attackers send messages that appear legitimate from trusted sources, encouraging victims to click links or download malicious attachments.
- Malware
  - Description: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
  - Types: Virus, worm, trojan, spyware, ransomware.
  - How it works: Malware can enter through unauthorized downloads, malicious email attachments, or infected websites.
- Ransomware
  - Description: A type of malware that encrypts victim's data and demands ransom for the decryption key.
  - How it works: Ransomware typically spreads through phishing emails or software vulnerabilities.
- DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
  - Description: Attacks aimed at making online services unavailable by overwhelming servers with excessive traffic.
  - How it works: Attackers use botnets (networks of malware-infected computers) to send a large number of requests to the target.
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  - Description: Attacks where the attacker intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge.
  - How it works: Attackers can intercept and alter data sent between users and websites or applications.
- SQL Injection
  - Description: Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to execute unauthorized SQL commands on databases.
  - How it works: Attackers insert malicious code into web application input forms, which is then executed by the database server.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Description: Attacks where attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites.
  - How it works: The malicious scripts are executed in the user's browser, which can steal data or redirect users to malicious websites.
- Password Attack
  - Description: Attacks that attempt to obtain user passwords.
  - Types: Brute force, dictionary attack, credential stuffing.
  - How it works: Attackers try various password combinations or use common password lists to gain access to victim accounts.
- Insider Threat
  - Description: Threats originating from within an organization by employees, former employees, contractors, or others with internal access.
  - How it works: Insiders can misuse legitimate access to steal data, damage systems, or disclose sensitive information.
- Zero-Day Exploit
  - Description: Attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities unknown to or unpatched by developers.
  - How it works: Attackers use these exploits before developers have a chance to fix them, making the attacks highly effective.
- Social Engineering
  - Description: Psychological manipulation to trick individuals into providing confidential information or performing certain actions.
  - Types: Phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating.
  - How it works: Attackers use psychological tactics to build trust and exploit human weaknesses.
