        Title: Cyber Attack Types on Application Security
        - Injection Attacks
          - SQL Injection: The attacker inserts malicious SQL code into queries sent to the database.
          - Command Injection: The attacker inserts malicious operating system commands through the application.
          - LDAP Injection: The attacker inserts malicious LDAP code to manipulate directories.
        - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
          - Stored XSS: Malicious scripts are stored on the server and executed by users when accessing infected data.
          - Reflected XSS: Malicious scripts are embedded in URLs and executed in the victim's browser when visiting the link.
          - DOM-Based XSS: Manipulates the DOM in the victim's browser to execute malicious scripts.
        - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The attacker sends malicious requests created by the user to the web application where the user is authenticated.
        - Broken Authentication and Session Management
          - Session Hijacking: The attacker steals or forges a user's session to gain unauthorized access.
          - Credential Stuffing: The attacker uses credentials stolen from other sites to attempt to access user accounts.
        - Security Misconfiguration
          - Default Configurations: Using insecure default configurations.
          - Unnecessary Features: Enabling unnecessary features that can be entry points for attacks.
        - Sensitive Data Exposure
          - Insecure Storage: Storing sensitive data without adequate encryption.
          - Insecure Transmission: Sending sensitive data over insecure connections.
        - Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
          - Lack of Logging: Not logging important activities that can help detect attacks.
          - Inadequate Monitoring: Not monitoring logs or network activities to detect signs of attacks.
        - Insecure Deserialization: The attacker sends deserialized objects with malicious code to be executed by the application.
        - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Using libraries or components with known vulnerabilities.
        - Broken Access Control
          - Horizontal Privilege Escalation: The attacker accesses data or functions of another user with the same access level.
          - Vertical Privilege Escalation: The attacker gains access to functions or data of a user with a higher access level.
        - Denial of Service (DoS): The attacker floods the application with requests, causing performance degradation or stopping functionality.
        - Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: The attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal or modify data.
        - Remote Code Execution (RCE): The attacker executes malicious code remotely on the target system.
        - Phishing and Social Engineering
          - Phishing: The attacker tricks users into providing sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.
          - Spear Phishing: Targeted phishing attacks on specific individuals or organizations.
        - Brute Force Attacks: The attacker tries various combinations of passwords or encryption keys until successful access is obtained.
